# Bookshop-with-RAG
Simple implementation of a web app for a bookshop, with CRUD functionalities and a RAG system for book recommendation

Users can query the system in natural language with their preferences (i.e. 'I would like a book to be read with bated breath'/'Vorrei leggere un libro che mi lasci con il fiato sospeso'), and they can get a recommended book from the bookshop archive.


Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Flask

RAG: Langchain - ChromaDB - OpenAI
